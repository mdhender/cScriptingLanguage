Sample CGI script implemented with CSL
--------------------------------------

This is not a tutorial in writing CGI scripts. You will find the fundamentals
about CGI programs at http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi

You need an OS/2 or NT/2000 webserver to run CGI scripts. (If you have either
VisualAge C++ V4 or DB2 UDB V5, the helpserver enclosed in those packages will
do for testing purpose. Cgi-bin will be mapped to \IMNNQ_NT or \NETQOS2
respectively by the helpserver.)

cgiform.htm   HTML form to test CGI sample

              Change the "action" argument of the form-tag to the URL of
              cgi-bin on your web server. The default setting is for the
              VAC helpserver.

cgiprog.cmd   Sample framework for CGI scripts

              This program should be copied to the cgi-bin directory of
              your webserver.

              You may have to set the PATH (and maybe BEGINLIBPATH) within
              this launcher script depending on your webserver, because
              normally a CGI does not have access to environment vars other
              than those set by the web server. When using the VAC helpserver
              this is not necessary.
